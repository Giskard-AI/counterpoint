Third-Party Notices

This product includes software developed by third parties. The following copyright, license, and NOTICE information is provided to satisfy attribution requirements for redistribution.

How this file is maintained
- Regenerate locally using Makefile targets:
  - make licenses       # generates licenses.json and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md
  - make licenses-check # fails if disallowed licenses are detected
  - make install-tools  # installs pip-licenses and other tools via uv

Notes on obligations
- Many permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, ISC, Apache-2.0) require preserving copyright and license text; Apache-2.0 may also include a NOTICE file whose contents must be carried forward.
- If any dependency uses attribution-required content (e.g., CC-BY) or copyleft licenses (GPL family), additional obligations may apply.

Dependency attributions
